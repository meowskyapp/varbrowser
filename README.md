# varbrowser | I developed an browser, support infinite split-screen

## backgroud

I am a product developer and I have a great need for information on the Internet every day.

Traditional browsers don't meet my need for fast access to information on the Internet, and I have developed my own
unlimited multi-screen browser for efficient access to information.

My working scenario is:

1 Every day, what's happening on the Internet, I will pay attention to reddit, x, instagram, Xiaohongshu, microblogging,
and browse several times a day.

2 Every morning, I need to check what developers around the world have released recently, I will browse github,
producthunt, hackernews, chrome-extension, and so on.

3 During the development process, I need to chat with multiple AI bots at the same time because each of them has its own
specialty, e.g. Qwen, poe, chatgpt, deepseek3.

4 I also bookmark things that I'm interested in while surfing the web, so I can come back to them when I need them.

## Traditional Browser Approach

I need to open multiple websites at the same time, and then click through each tab one by one.

I'm like a tool doing the same thing over and over again, and the tab switching is a pain in the ass;

When the number of tabs gets too high, I don't remember where I'm currently browsing, and it interrupts my train of
thought.

## varbrowser approach

I use my own development of Var Browser to solve this problem very easily

All I need to do is to check the current app I want to browse and open it with one click, and I can browse those pages
on the same page.

It's so cool that I can't work without it now because it lets me browse the web at 10x speed.ã€‚
